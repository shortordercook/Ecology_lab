# Physiological Ecology

## Background information
\newcommand{\textunderscript}[1]{$_{\text{#1}}$}
In the presence of light, photosynthetic organisms can utilize light and carbon dioxide (CO~2~) to make sugars - the process of photosynthesis. The sugars made are used by these organisms (and organisms that eat them) as a source of energy. A by-product of the photosynthetic process is the liberation of oxygen (O~2~).

At the same time, these organisms are consuming oxygen via respiration. Although respiration and photosynthesis both take place in the light, in the dark only respiration occurs (since photosynthesis is a light-dependent process). Though it is impossible to directly measure gross photosynthesis (or the total amount of O~2~ produced, [@wohlfahrt_many_2015], we *can* measure respiration (R) as the **rate of O~2~ decrease** in the dark, and the **rate of oxygen increase** in the presence of light as a measure of net photosynthesis (P~net~). Combining these direct measurements, we can estimate gross photosynthesis (P~gross~).

\begin{equation}
\color{blue} P_{net} \color{black}= \color{red}P_{gross} \color{black}- \color{blue}R
(\#eq:photosynthesis)
\end{equation}

Using equation \@ref(eq:photosynthesis) can directly measure the terms in \color{blue} blue \color{black}, and may use them to calculate \color{red} P~gross~ \color{black}.

Organisms capable of photosynthesis span an incredible range of phylogeny, from *unicellular algae* to *vascular plants* (Fig. \@ref(fig:organisms)). While every algae cell is photosynthetic, vascular aquatic plants (i.e. aquatic macrophytes) have large amounts of specialized tissue devoted to the transportation of resources and structural support. As Chapter \@ref(population) mentioned, every adaptation is a trade-off.

## Objectives

We will form hypotheses to test questions about photosynthesis in 2 aquatic organisms - a community of algae and a common aquatic macrophyte.

1. Which aquatic organism, algae or aquatic macrophyte, has the highest rate of *biomass specific* gross photosynthesis (P~gross~)?

2. Which organism has the highest rate of *biomass-specific* respiration?

3. Assuming these organisms photosynthesize at P~gross~ for 10 hours a day and respire for 24 hours a day, which organism has the highest rate of net primary production (P~net~) per day?

## Materials & methods

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}{}
  \item 10 L photosynthesis solution\footnote{10 L DI Water, 917 mg CaCl\textunderscript{2}, 960 mg MgSO\textunderscript{4}, 584 mg NaHCO\textunderscript{3}, 154 mg KHCO\textunderscript{3}}\\(40\% air saturation\footnote{Aerate with N\textunderscript{2} gas for 10 minutes})
  \item Samples of algae and macrophytes
  \item 330 mL BOD bottles
  \item Dissolved O\textsubscript{2} meter (D.O. Meter)
  \item Light source (> 400 \textmu E m\textsuperscript{-2}s\textsuperscript{-1})
  \item Aluminum foil
  \item Stir bars / stir plate
  \item Sieves (fine mesh)
  \item Forceps
  \item Drying boats (aluminum)
  \item Analytical balance \\(capable of 0.001 g)
  \item Drying oven
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

Oxygen production varies with the intensity of light, but reaches saturation as light intensity increases (Fig. \@ref(fig:light-response-fig)). Since different organisms display different light-response curves, we need to saturate the photosystems with high light levels to prevent a potential confounding variable in our experiment.

```{r light-response-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="A photosynthesis light-response curve illustrates that as light intensity increases, dissolved oxygen (D.O.) production eventually becomes saturated. In the dark, photosynthesis shuts off, and respiration causes the rate of D.O. production to fall below 0 (red circle on the y-axis)."}

```

### Methods

1. Each group will be responsible for **one** of the two species. Fill 9 BOD bottles with photosynthesis solution (fill to brim - the idea with BOD bottles is for the glass stopper to push any excess water out of the seal the stopper creates). 
2. Carefully transfer a representative sample of your organism into 8 of the BOD bottles. Add a small stir bar to each bottle, and place the glass stopper and plastic cap on the bottle to seal. Use the D.O. probe to measure oxygen concentration in the remaining bottle (your control bottle).
3. You will have 4 replicates for the dark treatment, and 4 for the light. Wrap the dark treatment bottles in aluminum foil, and place the light treatment bottles under the light source. \underline{Record the intial times for these samples}.
4. While you wait (at least 1.5 hours)...
    * Observe samples of these organisms under a dissecting/compound microscope and note differences in morphology. Note differences in the proportion of support tissues (i.e. stems) vs. photosynthetic tissues for each organism.
5. After at least 1.5 hours, measure D.O. concentrations in the light bottles. Make sure to record the end time each time you take a D.O. measurement.
6. After 2 hours, measure the D.O. concentrations in the dark bottles. Make sure to record the end time each time you take a D.O. measurement.
7. Carefully empty the BOD bottle into a fine-mesh sieve to separate the sample from the photosynthesis solution. Collect/scrape the sample into a labeled aluminum drying tin, and place tins into a drying oven for 24 hrs at 105\textdegree{}C.

## Data analysis

You can directly determine P~net~ (from the light treatment bottles) and R (from the dark treatment bottles) by calculating the change (\textDelta) in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations:

\begin{equation}
\Delta{}DO = DO_{final} - DO_{initial}
(\#eq:delta)
\end{equation}

You also recorded the elapsed incubation time(\textDelta{}h), the volume of the BOD bottles (0.330 L), and the mass of the sample (in dry weight, g). Using equation \@ref(eq:photosynthesis), after getting \textDelta{}DO normalized to volume (L) and dry weight (g), you can then calculate P~gross~, or the total oxygen produced by photosynthesis per unit biomass.

For the 1\textsuperscript{st}, and 2\textsuperscript{nd} questions, a two-sample t-test comparing the rates of each process (P~gross~ and R) will tell you if there are significant differences between each organism. Bar-graphs (with error-bars display the stardard error of the mean) are a good way of displaying this data visually. 

The 3\textsuperscript{rd} question requires you to construct a simple **model**. A model is a way to represent a natural process using mathematics. Some models are simple (like the one you will construct), and some are incredibly complex. What assumptions, which may be overly simplistic, can we make to tackle question 3? If we assume that these organisms respire for 24 hours a day, and only photosynthesize when the sunlight is out (10 hours a day), we can use these values as a foundation for our model (Fig. \@ref(fig:light-response-fig)).

```{r photo-model, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="A photosynthesis light-response curve illustrates that as light intensity increases, dissolved oxygen (D.O.) production eventually becomes saturated. In the dark, photosynthesis shuts off, and respiration causes the rate of D.O. production to fall below 0 (red circle on the y-axis)."}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter_materials/physiological_ecology/photo_model.pdf")
```

There are no associated statistical tests for question 3, since you should calculate daily values using mean P~gross~ and mean R (no replicate values for this question). You can present the results of your model in the text of your results section.
