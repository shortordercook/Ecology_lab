# Population Ecology {#population}

## Background information

Organisms have evolved different life history strategies which differ in their methods of reproduction, care of offspring, timing of growth, means of resource acquisition, and prey avoidance. While these factors and how they interact can be highly complex, **survivorship** offers a simple means to quantify how a particular population ensures their reproductive success. For example, humans devote an enormous amount of energy and resources to offspring care, which results in low mortality rates among their young. On the other hand, most insects produce a massive number of offspring that have extremely high rates of mortality.

Plotting the number of survivors against age yields what is called a 'survivorship-curve' (Fig. \@ref(fig:survivor-fig)), which is a visual way to assess how various organisms differ in their **life-history strategies** (number of offspring, number of reproductive cycles, degree of parental care, etc.). Scientists can use these plots to examine differences in organisms, or assess changes within subsets of a population.

```{r survivor-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Idealized examples of Types I, II, and III survivorship curves overlaid with example organisms. Type I survivorship is characterized by high probability of survival early in life, followed by a rapid decline as individuals reach older age. Type II survivorship displays roughly constant mortality throughout the lifespan of the organism, and Type III exhibits high mortality among young offspring."}

## Objectives

You will use the cemetery data, as well as data generated by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service [@milsap_bald_2016], to address hypotheses about different populations. We can use birth and death years on gravestones, as well as names (to infer gender), to collect simple but useful information to collect demographic data for the local human population. The survivorship curve you will generate from this data will inform some ideas about the life history strategy of humans.

```{r eagle-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Migratory Golden eagle in Denali National Park and Preserve. Mating pairs return each year to northern nesting territory in the spring, and most new fledglings leave the nest by mid-August. During winter their range extends from southern Canada to south of the Rocky Mountains[@brown_patterns_2017]."}

```

Additionally, survey data collected by state and federal agencies provide valuable information about natural population. We can use ancillary data about individuals within a population to examine how different forces influence demographics within a population. Golden Eagles are federally protected in the United States, and Fish & Wildlife collects detailed information from tagged individuals (Fig. \@ref(fig:eagle-fig)).

We will use this data to test hypotheses addressing the following questions:

1. Do humans and eagles display different life history strategies?
2. Does gender affect survivorship in human populations?
    * And if so, how?
3. Does human impact affect survivorship in eagle populations?
    * And if so, how?
  
Please form testable null hypotheses to address question number 1 and **either** question 2 or 3 (pick one). If you want, you may also substitute question 2 or 3 to address a hypothesis using the extra data we generated from the gravestones (height of gravestones as a proxy of material wealth). 

To evaluate your hypotheses, you will...

1. Statistically address differences in survivorship between groups using a **t-test**, and display that information using a **bar-graph**
2. Unpack question 1 by **computing** and **displaying survivorship** (no statistical test needed for this part).
