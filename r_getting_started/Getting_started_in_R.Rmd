abstract: "R is a programming language that is used by scientists in a wide variety of fields. It is open source (free to use and driven by community development) and installable on all major operating systems. RStudio is a separate installation from the R language, and is a desktop program that provides a graphical wrapper to the R language. The technical term for this type of program is *integrated development environment* (IDE), and it makes life much easier when using R.

This document will get you up and running in R and RStudio on your personal machine. You will need installation permission on your computer (if installing on your home computer you will almost certainly have this)."

# Installation

Depending on download and computer speed, you should plan to spend about 15 minutes installing both R and RStudio. The LaTeX download is much larger, and could take longer if you are not on fast internet. If on slow internet, I recommend connecting the power supply, making sure your computer is set to not go to sleep, and downloading the files overnight.

## R

We will use R for calculations, statistical analyses, and plotting data. R is generally more powerful than Excel or other 'point-and-click' programs, and once you generate code to perform a certain calculation or generate a graph, you may quickly reuse that code throughout the semester.

There are numerous online resources (including [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/d-u_7vdag-0)) that outline how to install R. Below are general instructions for a normal installation in Windows 10.

1. Navigate to the [R project homepage](https://www.r-project.org).
2. Click on the **CRAN** link under the **Download** header on the left side of the page. **CRAN** is an archival network that stores R and the majority of 3^rd^-party packages.
3. Choose your operating system, and then click through using either the **base** hyperlink or the **install R for the first time** hyperlink (they take you to the same place).
4. Click **Download R**, which will download an executable into your downloads folder.
5. Run this executable file, which will take you through the R installation process. Keep all defaults.

You now have the R language installed on your computer. If you were to open R, the base R terminal would appear (Fig. \@ref(fig:r-console)) At its simplest, R is run from this command line window. You could dive in and start scripting immediately, but there are programs that make navigating and writing in the R language a much more pleasant experience (i.e. R Markdown). 

```{r r-console, fig.cap="This is the R console, which you may open after installing R. The text that appears is non-editable, and includes some basic information about the current version of R you have installed (the R team gets creative with their version names). You may start scripting by typing next to the red greater-than sign. While completely functional, the R console lacks many 'bells-and-whistles' that a full IDE provides.", fig.align = "center", out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_console.png")
```


## RStudio

RStudio is a free, open-source **integrated development environment** (IDE) that significantly improves the R experience. It is a excellent text-editor, provides ways to import data into the R environment without writing code, and exports figures and documents. And again, if you prefer a visual walkthrough, there are many good YouTube videos that cover this installation.

1. Navigate to the [R Studio homepage](https://www.rstudio.com/). 
2. Click **Download R Studio**.
3. **Download** the free RStudio open source license. The other options add functionality for large teams of researchers, which we do not need for this lab.
4. Choose your operating system under **Installers for Supported Platforms**, which will download an executable file to your downloads folder.
5. Run this executable file, which will take you through the RStudio installation. Keep all defaults.

## LaTeX

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. Some people write in raw LaTeX, but RStudio provides a simpler Markdown language that is both easier to read and easier to learn. Below is a primarily windows-based walkthrough for installing a LaTeX distribution for use with RStudio.

RStudio recommends a complete installation of MiKTeX if you are a Windows user, and TexLive if you are Mac OS user. If you do not have a LaTeX distribution installed, Rstudio will throw an error when you try to *knit* your document and direct you toward the downloads page for your operating system. You will download a copy of the installer program from the distribution's website, and when you run that program it will download and install the actual LaTeX distribution. **CAUTION**: the LaTeX distribution is a rather large collection of files. Make sure you are on the fastest internet available to you, and that your roommate is not in the middle of an online game. I will also have a USB thumb-drive with this download in lab that you can transfer to your personal computer.

```{r latex-screenshots, fig.ncol = 2, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="MiKTeX download page (left pane) and installation window (right pane) showing correct version and choice options."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/miktex_download.png", "figures/miktex_complete.png"))
```

1. Download the installer for [Windows](http://miktex.org/2.9/setup) or [Mac OS](http://tug.org/mactex/) (Fig. \@ref(fig:latex-screenshots), left panel).
2. Open the MiKTex installer.
2. Accept copying conditions.
3. Choose the **Download MiKTeX** option and click next. In lab, I will also have a USB thumb-drive with this download.
4. Choose **Complete MiKTeX** and click next (Fig. \@ref(fig:latex-screenshots), right panel). This means you will not have to install different packages piecemeal every time you need a new function. 
5. Choose a download mirror somewhere in the United States and click next. *http* vs *https* does not really matter.
6. Accept the default installation directory and click next.
7. Click **Start**, which will begin the download. This is a rather large series of files. So go take a coffee break. 
8. Once downloaded, run the installer again and this time choose the **Install MiKTeX** option. Use default options throughout the installation process.
