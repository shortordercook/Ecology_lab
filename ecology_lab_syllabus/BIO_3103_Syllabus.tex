\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%
\section{Course Objectives}\label{course-objectives}}

The goal of this lab is to develop the student as a scientist by
exposure to basic research methodology in the field of ecology. You will

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  develop understanding of ecology as a scientific discipline, and
\item
  become familiar with some common methods used by ecologists (including
  field, laboratory, and data handling practices).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{general-information}{%
\section{General information}\label{general-information}}

Each lab will consist of the same general elements. You will (1) form
hypotheses, (2) collect some data, (3) analyze that data, and (4)
write-up the results. Ecology is synonymous with field research -
barring dangerous conditions (e.g., lightning) we will be outdoors if
the planned lab is outdoors. Rain or shine! Wearing clothes not suited
to field conditions will not be considered a valid excuse to not
participate in the lab, so dress appropriately.

In the lab, university policy is that you must wear closed-toe shoes and
long pants. Pay attention to the weather and dress appropriately for
outdoor conditions! For the wet labs I would wear old jeans or quick-dry
pants/shorts. Shorts could be fine- but we may be wading through
vegetation (scratchy). Old tennis shoes are highly recommended. You will
not be allowed to wade barefoot (i.e., you will not participate in that
lab, and lose participation points). More specific info will be provided
for each outdoor lab.

If you ever have questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to email
either Stephen (preferably) or Dr.~Doyle. We generally respond quickly
to emails, with the exception of the evening before lab reports are due
(Stephen will politely ignore report questions emailed after 5:00pm the
day before the assignment is due). Please get in touch if you need help
outside of lab - we are around and available to meet.

\hypertarget{laboratoryfield-activities}{%
\subsection{Laboratory/field
activities}\label{laboratoryfield-activities}}

It is important that students be aware that participating in laboratory
activities carries the risk, however small, of injury. Should you become
injured during activities in this class, be aware of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Notify your instructor immediately if you are injured or exposed to a
  chemical. Ask your instructor to provide the chemical safety data
  sheet (SDS) to take with you.
\item
  The Student Health Center can treat minor physical injuries such as
  cuts, burns, etc. The Health Center is open during campus business
  hours. After-hours medical care should be sought at an off-campus
  emergency care facility.
\item
  The Health Center does not provide emergency care for eye injuries or
  chemical exposures. In such cases, treatment should be sought at an
  emergency care center.
\item
  The nearest 24/7 emergency care center is Premier located at 221 N.
  Jack Kultgen Expy (254) 537-9452. Other nearby ERs include BSWMC
  Hillcrest and Express ER.
\item
  Depending on the type/extent of injury, an ambulance may be requested.
\item
  Medical expenses incurred as a result of a laboratory injury,
  including ambulance transport, are the financial responsibility of the
  student.
\end{itemize}

See below.

\hypertarget{analyses-in-r}{%
\subsection{Analyses in R}\label{analyses-in-r}}

R is a user-friendly programming language that scientists in a wide
variety of fields use for data analysis, graphing, and report
generation. If computer programming is completely foreign to you, don't
worry! You will be given everything you need for this lab.

We will be using RstudioCloud, which enables you to log-in online to
conduct your analysis and create figures for your reports. This document
will be due the same time as each Lab Report. Look to a separate handout
for information.

\hypertarget{field-trips-2x}{%
\subsection{Field trips (2x)}\label{field-trips-2x}}

Field trips will involve attendance as well as active participation,
which may include, for example, taking notes or completing a worksheet.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

\hypertarget{absences}{%
\subsection{Absences}\label{absences}}

As this is a lab (and thus an experienced-based) course, it is
imperative that you make it to class. Keep in mind that it is very
important to be on time, as we will frequently be leaving the lab to
collect data in the field. Tardiness is not a valid excuse for missing
class. Attendance policy is detailed in the Baylor University student
handbook. You will be automatically dropped from the class if you have 4
unexcused absences. Missing a lab is forfeiture of the points available
for that day. For labs that take up two days, missing one of the labs
will result in a 50\% deduction on the lab report. For an absence to be
excused, the instructor must receive documentation (e.g., doctor's or
chaplain's note). Students with excused absences may be given alternate
assignments.

\hypertarget{canvas}{%
\subsection{Canvas}\label{canvas}}

We will use Canvas to post data, report guidelines, readings, and
communications about the lab. You will also use Canvas to submit lab
reports. Each report will automatically be submitted to \emph{Turnitin},
and will be graded and scored on Canvas. \textbf{Please review any
comments/suggestions in order to improve your lab reports.} We suggest
you check Canvas each week before coming to class for any updated
announcements.

\hypertarget{cell-phones}{%
\subsection{Cell phones}\label{cell-phones}}

Please do not use your cell phone in lab unless instructed to do so.
Used responsibly, they can be an excellent tool to record data or steps
in the experiment (pictures or notes). If you chose to bring your cell
phone to the field, we are not responsible for them!

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Plagiarism or any form of cheating involves a breach of student-teacher
trust. This means that any work submitted under your name is expected to
be your own, neither composed by anyone else as a whole or in part, nor
handed over to another person for complete or partial revision. Be sure
to document all ideas that are not your own. Instances of plagiarism or
any other act of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Honor
Council and may result in failure of the course. Not understanding
plagiarism is not an excuse. You may use online resources to study for
this course, but you must do so in ways that are consistent with all
aspects of the Baylor University Honor Code (see, specifically, Section
III.C.12 and Section III.C.16). As a Baylor student, I expect you to be
intimately familiar with all aspects of the Honor Code, which can be
found at this link: \url{http://www.baylor.edu/honorcode/}.

Translation\ldots{} If you use outside resources, please cite them
appropriately, and do not copy directly from sources or the lab
handouts. Though we encourage you to work in partners/groups, you must
analyze the data and write reports independently. \textbf{Do not copy
from current/previous students' lab reports.} Please be advised that
each report will be automatically submitted to \emph{Turnitin} through
Canvas and assigned a similarity score.

\hypertarget{disabilities-policy}{%
\subsection{Disabilities policy}\label{disabilities-policy}}

Any student who needs academic accommodations related to a documented
disability should inform me immediately at the beginning of the
semester. You are required to obtain appropriate documentation and
information regarding accommodations from the Office of Access and
Learning Accommodation (OALA). Contact Information: (254) 710-3605 -
Paul L. Foster Success Center, 1st floor on the East Wing of Sid
Richardson.

\hypertarget{title-ix-statement}{%
\subsection{Title IX statement}\label{title-ix-statement}}

\hypertarget{lab-report-guidelines}{%
\section{Lab report guidelines}\label{lab-report-guidelines}}

Lab reports are due via electronic submission (Canvas) by the beginning
of lab time on the due dates mentioned on the course schedule. It is the
student's responsibility to turn in lab reports. Labs may be accepted up
to one week late and will receive a 30\% reduction in score (maximum
70\%), but will not be eligible for a rewrite. No labs will be accepted
more than one week late unless special circumstances are approved by TA
or Professor.

If you receive a failing score (\textless{} 70\%) on a report, and you
turned it in on time, you have the opportunity to rewrite and resubmit
the report for a maximum of 70\%. This rewrite will be due one week from
when the report is handed back. If you choose to take advantage of this,
please carefully consider the comments/corrections on your graded
report, and ask questions if necessary!

\hypertarget{style-and-format-for-written-report}{%
\subsection{Style and format for written
report}\label{style-and-format-for-written-report}}

Mirror your reports off the peer-reviewed studies we read in class.
Points may be taken off the lab report for poor grammar, syntax,
spelling, etc. Additionally, please be concise in your writing - a
hallmark of good scientific writing is finding a way to clearly convey
an idea in as few words as possible.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Briefly give introductory material explaining the importance of the lab
material (e.g., how it relates to ecology in general and why we care
about the subject matter). Pay attention during the lab set up- the
instructors will state most of what you need to know for this! At the
end of the introduction, you must also include a specific null research
hypothesis. You may also make a prediction about the Results based on
information you've given in the Introduction - that is, you may state an
alternate hypothesis. This alternate hypothesis should say whether you
think there will be an effect, and in what direction that effect will
occur.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Establish the question you are interested in with a general objectives
  statement: \emph{``The objective of this study was to determine the
  effectiveness of the Lab Report Guidelines in aiding student
  success.''}
\item
  Turn that question into a hypothesis that can be nullified with some
  degree of certainty: \emph{``We tested the null hypothesis that
  students who read the Lab Report Guidelines, and those that do not,
  receive similar scores on their Lab Reports.''}
\item
  Determine a plausible alternative hypothesis that your data could
  support if the null hypothesis is rejected: \emph{``Our alternative
  hypothesis was that students who read the Guidelines would perform
  better than students who did not.''}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

Begin with a general, overarching statement about what you did, then
clearly summarize what was done in lab to address the hypotheses. The
KEY points of all experimental design, data collection, and data
analysis should be included. Make sure to include details about any
calculations and/or statistics you used, and how you used them.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

Summarize the data collected and the results used to address the
hypothesis. The results in the text (in paragraph form) should be
graphically represented - you will use the R to generate your figures,
\textbf{with appropriate labelling of axes and legends, if applicable.}
Clearly state the results of the statistical test employed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Graphs and tables MUST have a detailed caption explaining the
  contents!
\item
  Figures must have labeled axes that include the units (if appropriate)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Explain if the null hypothesis stated in the introduction was rejected
or supported (you should remind the reader what hypothesis you were
testing). Describe what the Results mean in the context of your
Introduction. While the Results section details \emph{what} you found,
the Discussion section should be dedicated to rationalizing \emph{why}
you think your data displayed these results.
