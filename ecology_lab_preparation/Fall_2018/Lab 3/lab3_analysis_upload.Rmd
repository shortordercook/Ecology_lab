## Import packages


```{r, message=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(lubridate)
```


## Import data


```{r}
lww <- read.csv(file = "lww_fall_18.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
```

## Calculations

Is management activity influencing the *abundance* of cattail?

```{r}
management_abundance <- lww %>%
  select(CELL, CAT_PRESENT) %>%
  group_by(CELL) %>%
  summarise(CAT_PRESENT = sum(CAT_PRESENT)) %>%
  mutate(CAT_ABSENT = 50 - CAT_PRESENT)


managment.abund <- chisq.test(management_abundance, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
managment.abund
```

Is management activity influencing the *dominance* of cattail?



Is management activity influencing species richness?



Does typha dominance influence species richness?
